# basketGame
My first game in Pygame!\

# How To Play:
There will be characters dropping randomly from the top and the user will have 3 option, 'a' for alphabets, 'n' for numbers and 'p' for punctuations. Each time the user gets it right, 3 point will be added and the speed of the next character would be increased and each time the user gets it wrong, points would decrease by 3 points and the speed would be increased.\

# What I learned: 
PyGame 

# Note: 
This is a basic game as I this was the first time I used Pygame, I will be building more games in the future.
